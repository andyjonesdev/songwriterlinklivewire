            <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">Does SongwriterLink collect royalties?</h3>
            <p class="my-2">We do not handle the tracking or payment of royalties. This responsibility lies with royalty collection agencies. We strongly encourage all songwriters to register with the appropriate agency in their region to ensure they receive the royalties they’re entitled to. For example, in the United States, BMI and ASCAP are commonly used, while in the United Kingdom, PRS is a popular option.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Performance royalties are managed locally in each country by a Performing Rights Organisation (PRO), which represents composers and lyricists. These organisations typically require broadcasters (such as TV and radio stations) and live music venues to pay an annual blanket license fee that covers the music they broadcast or host live.</p>
            <p class="my-2">The license fees collected from all broadcasters and venues are pooled into a fund. A portion of this fund is allocated to pay royalties to composers and lyricists. To ensure accurate payments, broadcasters are required to submit a ‘cue sheet’—a document detailing the music used, including information about the composer. Live venues complete a similar report. These documents are submitted to the local PRO, which then calculates and distributes royalty payments to the appropriate rights holders.</p>
            <p class="my-2"><b>Please note:</b> It is the responsibility of broadcasters and venue owners—not SongwriterLink license purchasers—to pay performance royalties.</p>
            <p class="my-2">All performance royalties go directly to the composer or lyricist. SongwriterLink does not take any percentage of these payments.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">How much should I charge for my lyrics?</h3>

            <p class="my-2">At SongwriterLink, you have the flexibility to set your own prices. You can set them upto $100. Most of our lyrics are sold for between $30 and $60. We take a 20% commission on every sale and that’s the only fee. Unlike many other platforms, we do force you to take out a subscription to sell your lyrics.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">How do the licences work?</h3>

            <p class="my-2">In simple terms, a license allows someone to use your lyrics for a specific purpose—similar to a loan, but in the music industry, we call it a “license.” The buyer pays you a fee for the license and gains the legal right to use your work for one specific project or song.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Licensing is beneficial for both parties:</p>
            <p class="my-2">Sellers retain full ownership and control of their copyright and are also entitled to earn performance and broadcast royalties whenever their work is used.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Buyers gain the legal right to use the work without having to purchase the copyright itself.</p>
            <p class="my-2">All SongwriterLink licenses are non-exclusive, which means you can license the same work to multiple buyers for different projects—maximizing your potential income. For example, licensing one lyric to 10 buyers for 10 unique songs could result in 10 separate license fees and royalty payments.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">What rights or permissions do I need to upload lyrics?</h3>

            <p class="my-2">To use our service, you must either fully own the rights to any material you upload, license, or sell through SongwriterLink — or own a share of the rights and have obtained explicit permission from all co-writers or rights holders.</p>
            <p class="my-2">If you do not hold these rights, or do not have permission from all relevant parties, you are not permitted to use our service. If you’re unsure about any of these terms, please seek clarification before uploading your work.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Do not upload material that you do not own, including cover versions or works by other artists. Unauthorized use of copyrighted material is a serious offense and may result in legal action.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">How do I copyright my songs?</h3>

            <p class="my-2">Copyright is automatically granted to the composer or author the moment a lyric is created. However, as with any form of online publication or public performance, there is always a risk that your work could be copied or used without your permission.</p>
            <p class="my-2">Copyright protection is important and will make sure your work is safe from misuse or anyone using your lyrics without permission.</p>
            <p class="my-2">We have another service called CopyrightSolved that will protect your lyrics very easily for a small fee. When you upload your material to CopyrightSolved, you can do so with confidence, knowing that your work is not only published but also safeguarded.
